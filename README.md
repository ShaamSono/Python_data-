Mini Python Data Analytics Project

📊 Mini Python Data Analytics Project
Project Overview
This is my first mini Python project in the field of data analytics. The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset, extract meaningful insights, and visualize the results using Python. Through this project, I aim to practice fundamental data analysis skills, including data cleaning, data manipulation, and visualization.

Project Objectives
🔍 Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and correct data types.
📈 Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and trends.
📊 Data Visualization: Use libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create charts and graphs that make the data easy to understand.
🌐 Optional Integration: If applicable, integrate external data sources using APIs (e.g., weather data from OpenWeatherMap).

Technologies & Libraries Used
Python: The core language used for data analysis.
colab Notebook: For running and documenting the analysis process.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For creating static visualizations.
Pyspan: For Data Cleaning and manipulation 
Seaborn: For enhanced data visualization with easier syntax.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is ('/content/hotel_dataset.csv'). It contains information about Hotel

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.7 or higher). You can download Python from the official website.

Installation
import pandas as pd
!pip install pyspan
import pyspan as ps
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

Key Learnings
How to clean and preprocess data using Pandas.
Visualizing trends and patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Integrating external data using APIs (optional).
Drawing insights from data through EDA.
